  A bit of information about my Spotify data analysis website.
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

As mentioned in the introduction, Spotify allows its users to download the information the music company has about them.
I thought this could be interesting, so I downloaded my information and dug into it.
The entire data preparation and analysis is presented in this website.
